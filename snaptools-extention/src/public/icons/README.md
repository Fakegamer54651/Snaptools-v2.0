# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the extension icon in multiple sizes:

- `16.png` - 16x16px (toolbar icon, small display)
- `32.png` - 32x32px (Windows and other platforms)
- `48.png` - 48x48px (extension management page)
- `128.png` - 128x128px (Chrome Web Store, installation)

## Creating Icons

1. Design your icon as a 128x128px PNG with transparent background
2. Scale down to create the smaller sizes
3. Ensure the icon is recognizable at all sizes
4. Use simple, clear design with high contrast

## Temporary Placeholders

For development, you can use solid color squares as placeholders:
- Create simple colored PNG files at each size
- Or use an online icon generator

## Production

Replace these placeholder instructions with actual SnapTools branded icons before release.
